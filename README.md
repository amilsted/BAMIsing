# BAMIsing
Simple Monte Carlo simulation of the 2D Ising model with BitArrays in Julia

It is split into a few notebooks:
* partition_function: Evalutates the 2D Ising model partition function and computes some interesting physical quantitites.
* monte_carlo: Introduces Metropolis sampling and binning, followed by Cluster updates.
